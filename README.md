# Kuberdog Chrysalis
A [cybernetic Chrysalis](https://github.com/kuberlog/chrysalis) for dogs.

## Minimal Viable Increment
- A box housing an arduino with a push button on top and a usb cable that extends out of the box so it can connect with cybernetics, specifically in my use case, a daemon running on my Serval76. The push button sends a signal in the [standard format](https://github.com/kuberlog/chrysalis#standard_format) to the daemon. This increment is intended for use with the [Z-trainer]().
